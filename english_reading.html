`An incredible journey.
IN OCTOBER 1604, something remarkable appeared in the night sky. Without warning, a light brighter than any star suddenly lit up the darkness. Early astronomers saw it as a miraculous portent of things to come. None of them guessed what it really was - the dying light of a distant star that had exploded thousands of years before.
Now known as Kepler's Star after the astronomer who watched it for more than a year, the supernova helped to usher in a new era of space exploration. Within a few years Galileo Galilei was pioneering the use of the telescope, using one he'd designed himself to observe hills and valleys on the moon, spots on the sun, the phases of Venus, the stars of the Milky Way and, most famously, the satellites of Jupiter. Tycho Brahe, Christian Huygens and other greats of early astronomy were soon making discoveries of their own.
We are still in the golden age of discovery kick-started by these pioneers. We now have telescopes the size of football fields peering deeper into space than Kepler could have imagined. And for the past 60 years we have been sending satellites, craft, probes, humans and instruments into space to get an even closer look. Right now, the Curiosity rover is sending back snapshots from the surface of Mars and the Philae lander is hitchhiking out of our solar system aboard a passing comet.
Thanks to these tools of exploration our knowledge of the cosmos is constantly expanding all the time. As just one example, when the European Space Agency's Gaia mission finishes in 2018, its telescope will have photographed over a billion stars, providing us with the most accurate three-dimensional map of the heavens ever drawn.The memory of the swashbuckling race to the moon may be fading, but space exploration is as vibrant as ever.
This issue of New Scientist: The Collection roams the frontiers of that inspirational quest.
It will illuminate some of the deepest mysteries of the universe and help you see our own cosmic corner in astonishing detail.
Chapter 1 takes a journey around our solar system. Meet the robots climbing the mountains of Mars, visit some of our neighbourhood's most unusual moons, stare at the surface of the sun and get to know the spacecraft struggling to cross the solar system's last horizon.
Chapter 2 widens the aperture to explore our home galaxy, the Milky Way. We no longer think it is the entire universe, but still many of its secrets elude us, from the black hole at its centre to the stars that may have formed alongside our sun.
Chapter 3 returns to more familiar - if still very alien - territory in the shape of the Earth-like planets that may be strewn across the cosmos. What strange worlds are they? Are they - or their moons - capable of supporting intelligent life? And how would we know what to look for?
Finally, Chapter 4 plunges into the depths of space to check out some of its most unusual inhabitants, from the galaxies too perfect to exist to the stars larger than we thought possible.
We may no longer rely on the naked eye to scan the heavens, but there's plenty we still don't know. Let New Scientist take you to the very limits of our knowledge, and guide you through the questions that will power the next centuries of discovery.

`Wild things.
Life on Earth, Charles Darwin wrote in On the Origin of Species, is full of "endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful". Anyone who has visited a rainforest, a coral reef or even an English meadow knows what he was talking about.
Life is dazzling, fecund, diverse and yet fragile.
Earth is the only planet we know where it exists, and we are right to exult in it.
This issue of New Scientist: The Collection is dedicated to Earth's stunning, fascinating and most fragile wildlife. From the tropics to the poles, the depths of the oceans to the peaks of the Himalayas, life is everywhere.
In these pages you'll encounter the most interesting organisms the planet has to offer complemented with stunning wildlife photography.
We begin, in Chapter 1, with our own kin: the mammals. From the plight of the rarest primates to the extraordinary social bonds of some of the largest animals on Earth, these are tales of survival, recovery and, in some cases, extinction. Pulling the stories together, it is possible to see a glimmer of hope for the 26 remaining Hainan gibbons in the remarkable comebacks of Europe's large predators and Canada's adorable sea otters. Or will they go the way of the world's largest ape and the mysterious wolf of the south Atlantic?
In Chapter 2, we take to the skies. Birds are no less fascinating than mammals, and in some cases equally imperilled. One particularly poignant story is the operation to save the Chatham Island black robin, a heroic and successful effort - although it did have a strange effect on the bird's eggs. You'll also meet pelicans, cormorants, wild turkeys and an owl that appears to be horribly lost.
Chapter 3 is all about the oceans and the fascinating beasts that live in it. Did you know that by eating vast quantities of fish and krill, whales make the oceans richer not poorer?
That a sly red devil is taking over the eastern Pacific? Or that one of the most valuable materials on Earth is rotten marine excrement? One of our writers has gone hunting for it, so you don't have to.
Chapter 4 brings us back to earth with an exploration of some of the most peculiar plants the planet has to offer. Some are carnivorous and seem to draw in small bats and shrews. Others, incredibly, show signs of intelligence.
Chapter 5 is dedicated to the cold, slimy and yet oddly endearing. We learn that the "Lazarus frogs" offer hope for a group of animals that has been decimated by a ferocious fungus, and then head to the Balkans on a quest to find the world's largest and fiercest cave dweller (spoiler alert: it is neither very large nor very fierce, but incredibly rare). Along the way, we learn a thing or two about where snakes come from and how turtles find their way home.
The weirdest and most wonderful wild things are saved for last. Chapter 6 is all about the extremes, from the Arctic Ocean's very own sea unicorns to the tiniest geckos, fish and frogs, which fit on a human fingernail.
What is the biggest organism on Earth? The oldest? The driest? All will be revealed.

`Where must the puma have come from?
Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America. When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.
The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. Several people complained of "cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside`
